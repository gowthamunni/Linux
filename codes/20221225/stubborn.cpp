#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>


int main(){

//key and value. So we need do declare what datatype the components of map is going to be.
std::map<std::string, int> football;
// what does this mean? football must be a pointer. Since it's a map it should point to the string. Now map has two attributes (let's think of it that way for now).How would you create such a structure or class ? How to create connection ?
